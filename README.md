Kurento Utils for Node.js and Browsers
======================================

The Kurento Utils project contains a set of reusable components that have been
found useful during the development of the WebRTC applications with Kurento.

The source code of this project can be cloned from the [GitHub repository].

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Be sure to have installed [Node.js] and [Bower] in your system:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g bower
```

To install the library, it's recommended to do that from the [NPM repository] :

```bash
npm install kurento-utils
```

Alternatively, you can download the code using git and install manually its
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-utils-js
cd kurento-utils-js
npm install
```

Screen and window sharing depends on the privative module
```kurento-browser-extensions```. To enable its support, you'll need to install
the package dependency manually or use a ```getScreenConstraints``` function
yourself on runtime. If it's not available, when trying to share the screen or
a window content it will throw an exception.

### Browser

To build the browser version of the library you'll only need to exec the [grunt]
task runner and they will be generated on the ```dist``` folder. Alternatively,
if you don't have it globally installed, you can run a local copy by executing

```bash
node_modules/.bin/grunt
```
